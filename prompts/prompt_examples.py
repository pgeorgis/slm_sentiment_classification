EXAMPLE_NEGATIVE_REVIEW = """"The Lost Journey" tries hard to be profound but falls flat with its overly sentimental and predictable storyline. The pacing is excruciatingly slow, with long, drawn-out scenes that add little to the narrative. While the cinematography is visually impressive, it feels like style over substance, as the film struggles to deliver any real emotional impact. The protagonist’s journey feels forced and lacks authenticity, making it difficult to connect with their struggles. The dialogue is often cliché, and the supporting characters are one-dimensional. Despite its ambition, the film ultimately feels hollow and fails to live up to its potential. Save your time and skip this one."""
